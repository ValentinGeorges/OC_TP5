I coded the front-end of this E-Commerce website with Vanilla.js.

If you want to see the web site, all you have to do is to have node.js installed locally and to clone this repo : https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5, open the terminal within this folder, run "npm install", then run "npm start" and finally go to this link : https://valentingeorges.github.io/OC_TP5/.

If you have a problem launching the server, try modifying the line 14 of the file "app.js" with this : { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }) and it should work fine.
